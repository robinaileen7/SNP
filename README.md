# Kyoto University MA Thesis â€“ An Application of a Shot-Noise Process to Keiretsu Networks (Rewritten in Python)
My master's thesis explored the impact 
of keiretsu (business interlocking) on the relationship between Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) and its suppliers. I  approximated companies' unobservable asset 
values reversely using Black-Scholes, and retrieved shot-noise parameters on maximum likelihood method.
